# Visual_Calculator_and_number_alogrithms
Two python "games" that use a common functions class


Arithmetic Game imports functions.py
Input:
  Takes in number of attempts you would like to try.
  Takes in width of the numbers and functions you would like to visually see (5-10).
  Takes in which character you would like to use to paint the numbers and functions (can be anything on keyboard).
  Takes in whether or not you would like to enter drill mode. 
    If this mode is activated by the user they
    will be re-prompted to solve a problem that they got incorrect. Points are turned
    off in ”drill” mode since the user can attempt a problem multiple times.
  If drill mode is not on then the program keeps track of the users score and return it at the end to the user when they choose to end the program
  If user tries to input an option that is not stated they will be asked to try again until a true option is chosen
  
Output:
  Depending on which options is chosen game will begin and user will be asked to solve different types of visually printed math equations
  Prints out number of attempted problems
  Prints out percentage of each type of problem attempted and solved correctly
  If in drill mode user will be asked to keep trying a problem until they get it correct


Number Algorithms imports functions.py
Input:
  Takes in option number 1-5 if user doesnt enter 1-5 program asks user to enter a valid choice.
  Entering 5 ends the program.
  
Output:
  Depending on selection program will find prime numbers, perfect numbers, abundant numbers, and can chart all of the previous options at once within a given range.
  Prints out selection
